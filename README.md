# BMI_Calculator

The project is based off of some designs i made in Figma. 
It's supposed to focus more on the "Front-end" of things like UI/UX making use of transitions and animations, so there will not be much "programming work" here like js. 

Note: That if you try out the code before i added the responsiveness that the code could/might look out of place so be aware!
